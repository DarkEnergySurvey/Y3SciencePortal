-- comparing small sample (5 bands) with or without point sources. 

* properties_small_5bands_sg versus properties_small_5bands_nosg

The biggest effect is seen in the plot magnitude versus redshift, how removing point sources actually removes a weird locus of bright objects at very high redshift and also in the color color plots, it can be seen a small locus that dissapears. 

So everything is pointing that we are going in the right direction!


-- comparing small sample (5bands) with point sources in versus (4bands) with point sources in.

* properties_small_5bands_nosg versus properties_small_4bands_nosg

Nothing different

-- Comparing small sample (4bands) with point sources in versus y1like (4bands) with point sources in 

* properties_small_4bands_nosg verus properties_y1like_4bands_nosg

in plot r-i r auto, none of them cover a region in r-i >1.5

Nothing different really


PHOTOZ -----------

-- Comparing 4 bands with 5 bands

* 1978/dnf_4bands_small.ipynb versus 1986/dnf_5bands_small

Very little gain. 5bands have more 3sigma outliers at high redshift but it is uncertain if it is by lack of data, or other reason.

5bands seems to improve in sigma68, maybe, but not clear either.
4bands better bias?

-- Comparing 4 bands DNF to MLZ, Lephare and Annz2

* 1978/dnf_4bands_small.ipynb versus 1982/mlzlephare...ipynb

Very similar results!!

-- Comparing 5 bands with and without stars in:

* 1986/dnf_5bands_small versus 1990/dnf_5bands_small_nopointsources.ipynb

nopointsources tem bias melhor better high redshift and less outliers better Npoisson

with pointsources we have high redshift better sigma68

-- Comparing 4bands small with y1like with point sources

* 1978/dnf_4bands_small.ipynb versus 1991/dnf_4bands_y1like.ipynb

Small one seems to have better metrics. Better Npoisson big difference
